Welcome!!

Currently, I'm working as a Research Associate at [Idiap](https://www.idiap.ch/en) research institute. I'm actively collaborating with Dr. Petr Motlicek in the [Speech and Audio Processing Group](https://www.idiap.ch/en/scientific-research/speech-and-audio-processing). Until December 2022, I held a tenured position at the Universidad Autónoma Metropolitana campus Cuajimalpa ([UAM-C](https://www.cua.uam.mx/)) in Mexico City. I'm an active member of the Language and Reasoning research group ([LyR](http://lyr.cua.uam.mx/)) in the Information Technologies Department. In addition, I'm an external member of the Laboratory of Language Technologies ([LabTL](http://ccc.inaoep.mx/labtl/)) of the Computational Sciences Department at the National Institute of Astrophysics, Optics and Electronics ([INAOE](https://www.inaoep.mx/)), located in Puebla, Mexico. I’m also a member of the Mexican Association for Natural Language Processing ([AMPLN](http://ampln.mx/portal/inicio)), the Hispano-American Network for Automatic Human Language Processing (RedHisTAL), and member of the Mexican Academy of Computer Science ([AMEXCOMP](https://amexcomp.mx/)).

I have over 10 years of experience in the Computer Science field. My primary research interests include the areas of Computational Linguistics (CL), Information Retrieval (IR), and Natural Language Processing (NLP). During the early stages of my career, I focused on statistical approaches and computational models to solve very specific NLP tasks, e.g., single and multiple document summarization, information retrieval, thematic and non-thematic text classification, text mining techniques, etc. More recently, I've been reorienting my research towards the intersection of NLP and Social Sciences, with special emphasis on applied NLP in Psycholinguistics,  Authorship Analysis (AA), and Semantic Analysis (SA) from automatic transcripts.
