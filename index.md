## A Life in Science and Innovation!

I grew up in Finnish Lapland, on the Arctic side of the Polar Circle, where the vast wilderness sparked my early curiosity about the fundamental nature of matter, space, and time. This passion led me to pursue a B.Sc. in Physics at the University of Helsinki, launching a career that spans decades of discoveries and innovations

While completing my PhD in High Energy Physics at Fermilab, I joined the world’s most renowned research facilities. At CERN and Fermilab, I played an integral role in groundbreaking particle physics experiments, contributing to frontier studies at CERN and the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer aboard the International Space Station. Working alongside visionaries like Nobel laureates Leon Lederman and Samuel Ting, I helped shape modern particle physics and laid the groundwork for cutting-edge technology applications.

Over time, I shifted my focus to challenges that directly impact people's lives. Drawing on my expertise in precision instrumentation, I co-founded Holobiont Oy with Abraham Villatoro Tello to revolutionize health monitoring. Today, I lead the development of the VOC Communicator™, a non-invasive device that interprets volatile organic compounds (VOCs) to provide real-time health insights. Powered by machine learning and information theory, this system offers a groundbreaking approach to preventive healthcare through its interactive, cloud-based app.

Balancing scientific exploration with practical innovation has been a constant in my career. With over 30 patents, a wealth of publications, and experience transferring lab technologies to real-world applications, I have always pursued solutions that make a difference. Currently, as a visiting professor at CERN and an innovator at Holobiont Oy, I remain committed to pushing the boundaries of science and improving lives through transformative health technologies
