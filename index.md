## A Life in Science and Innovation!

From a young physicist captivated by the mysteries basic structure of matter, space and time to a pioneer in health monitoring technology, now I hold a career that spans decades of discoveries and transformative innovations.

Starting with a B.Sc. in Physics from the University of Helsinki, my journey took me to the world’s most prestigious research facilities. As a Ph.D. graduate in High Energy Physics and later a senior scientist at CERN and Fermilab, I contributed to some of the most significant particle physics experiments, including frontier experiments at Fermilab, CERN and the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer aboard the International Space Station. Alongside Nobel laureates like Leon Lederman and Samuel Ting, my work shaped modern particle physics while laying a foundation for technology applications beyond the lab.

After years of leading international research collaborations, I shifted toward solving challenges closer to home. Drawing my experience in designing precision instruments for particle detection, co-founded Holobiont Oy to develop non-invasive health monitoring systems. My current work with the VOC Communicator™ reflects a deep commitment to advancing preventive healthcare. This revolutionary device translates volatile organic compounds (VOCs) into actionable health insights, offering users real-time feedback through a cloud-based app. It’s more than a device—it’s a digital health companion powered by machine learning and information theory.

Throughout my career, I’ve balanced rigorous scientific inquiry with a drive to deliver practical solutions. With over 30 patents, a vast portfolio of publications, and a history of technology transfer initiatives, I’m still in the search of new discoveries. Today, as a visiting professor at CERN and an innovator at Holobiont Oy, I want to continue to inspire, innovate, and improve lives.
