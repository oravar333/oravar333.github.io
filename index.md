## A Life in Science and Innovation!

From a young physicist captivated by the mysteries basic structure of matter, space and time to a pioneer in health monitoring technology, now I hold a career that spans decades of discoveries and transformative innovations.

Starting with a B.Sc. in Physics from the University of Helsinki, my journey took me to the world’s most prestigious research facilities. As a Ph.D. graduate in High Energy Physics and later a senior scientist at CERN and Fermilab, I contributed to some of the most significant particle physics experiments, including frontier experiments at Fermilab, CERN and the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer aboard the International Space Station. Alongside Nobel laureates like Leon Lederman and Samuel Ting, my work shaped modern particle physics while laying a foundation for technology applications beyond the lab.

After years of leading international research collaborations, I shifted toward solving challenges closer to home. Drawing my experience in designing precision instruments for particle detection, co-founded Holobiont Oy to develop non-invasive health monitoring systems. My current work with the VOC Communicator™ reflects a deep commitment to advancing preventive healthcare. This revolutionary device translates volatile organic compounds (VOCs) into actionable health insights, offering users real-time feedback through a cloud-based app. It’s more than a device—it’s a digital health companion powered by machine learning and information theory.

Throughout my career, I’ve balanced rigorous scientific inquiry with a drive to deliver practical solutions. With over 30 patents, a vast portfolio of publications, and a history of technology transfer initiatives, I’m still in the search of new discoveries. Today, as a visiting professor at CERN and an innovator at Holobiont Oy, I want to continue to inspire, innovate, and improve lives.

Currently, I'm working as a Researcher at [Idiap](https://www.idiap.ch/en) research institute. I'm actively collaborating with Dr. Petr Motlicek in the [Speech and Audio Processing Group](https://www.idiap.ch/en/scientific-research/speech-and-audio-processing). Until December 2022, I held a tenured position at the Universidad Autónoma Metropolitana campus Cuajimalpa ([UAM-C](https://www.cua.uam.mx/)) in Mexico City. I'm an active member of the Language and Reasoning research group ([LyR](http://lyr.cua.uam.mx/)) in the Information Technologies Department. In addition, I'm an external member of the Laboratory of Language Technologies ([LabTL](http://ccc.inaoep.mx/labtl/)) of the Computational Sciences Department at the National Institute of Astrophysics, Optics and Electronics ([INAOE](https://www.inaoep.mx/)), located in Puebla, Mexico. I’m also a member of the Mexican Association for Natural Language Processing ([AMPLN](http://ampln.mx/portal/inicio)), the Hispano-American Network for Automatic Human Language Processing (RedHisTAL), and member of the Mexican Academy of Computer Science ([AMEXCOMP](https://amexcomp.mx/)).

I have over 13 years of experience in the Computer Science field. My primary research interests include the areas of Computational Linguistics (CL), Information Retrieval (IR), and Natural Language Processing (NLP). During the early stages of my career, I focused on statistical approaches and computational models to solve very specific NLP tasks, e.g., single and multiple document summarization, information retrieval, thematic and non-thematic text classification, text mining techniques, etc. More recently, I've been reorienting my research towards the intersection of NLP and Social Sciences, with special emphasis on applied NLP in Psycholinguistics,  Authorship Analysis (AA), and Semantic Analysis (SA) from automatic transcripts.
